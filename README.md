# WTF is Vibe Coding? ðŸ¤–âš¡

A cyberpunk-themed presentation about building AI workflows as a non-developer

## What This Presentation Covers

This slideshow explores the world of "vibe coding" - the art of building powerful AI-driven applications and workflows without being a traditional software developer. It's designed for curious minds who want to harness AI's potential through creative problem-solving and smart tool usage.

### Key Topics Include:

- **Understanding AI Capabilities**: What AI actually does beyond the hype - pattern recognition, text generation, reasoning, and automation
- **Building with AI Tools**: From ChatGPT + Zapier to custom AI agents and coding assistants
- **Essential Patterns**: Multi-shot learning, persona-based interactions, expert system simulation, and tool integration
- **Prerequisites & Skills**: The minimal technical knowledge needed to get started (spoiler: it's less than you think!)
- **Tool Progression**: From beginner-friendly platforms like Replit and Bolt to advanced workflows in Google Colab
- **AI Agents & Workflows**: Creating autonomous systems that can work independently and integrate with real data sources
- **Project Planning**: How to approach AI projects with proper documentation and realistic expectations
- **Best Practices**: Security considerations, testing strategies, and community resources

## Who This Is For

- **Curious Non-Developers**: People with basic technical literacy who want to build AI-powered solutions
- **Creative Problem Solvers**: Those who see opportunities for automation and enhancement in their work/life
- **AI Enthusiasts**: Anyone interested in practical AI applications beyond just chatting with ChatGPT
- **Entrepreneurs & Makers**: People looking to prototype and build AI-enhanced products or services

## The Vibe

This presentation embraces a cyberpunk aesthetic with:
- Dark terminal-inspired theme
- Neon green accents and glowing effects
- Grid patterns and retro-futuristic styling
- Animated elements and smooth transitions
- A focus on the "hacker" mentality of creative problem-solving

## Philosophy

The core message is that AI is a powerful tool that's becoming increasingly accessible to non-traditional developers. By understanding key patterns, learning basic prompt engineering, and leveraging the right tools, anyone can build sophisticated AI workflows that solve real problems.

The presentation emphasizes starting small, testing thoroughly, and gradually building up to more complex solutions - all while maintaining a healthy respect for AI's limitations and security considerations.
